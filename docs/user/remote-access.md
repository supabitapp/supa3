# Remote access

Connect a phone, browser, or another desktop app to Supacode running on a different
machine. That machine must stay running and reachable while you work.

## Pair over a LAN or private network

Use direct pairing when the other device can reach the host's network address.

On a desktop host, open **Settings → Connections**, enable **Network access**,
then create a pairing link using an address the other device can reach. Changing
network access restarts the desktop app. You can turn it off in the same place.

For a command-line host, replace `<private-ip>` with the host's LAN or tailnet
address:

```bash
supacode serve --host <private-ip>
```

If a server is already running, generate a fresh link without restarting it:

```bash
supacode pair
```

Scan the QR code on your phone or paste the pairing URL into **Add environment**
in the receiving app. Connection settings are under **Settings → Connections**
on web and desktop and **Settings → Environments** on mobile. A loopback address
such as `127.0.0.1` reaches only the device opening the link.

Pairing links include alternative host addresses when available. The in-app
scanner and **Add environment** can use a reachable alternative when the main
address is unavailable, including when pairing a new device away from the LAN.
Older links can use another saved route when the main address belongs to one
saved machine. Each alternative must identify the intended environment before
receiving the token. A phone camera opening an unreachable LAN URL in a browser
cannot load the app to try those alternatives; use the in-app scanner or paste
the link instead.

Pairing authorizes that device for future connections. Use a fresh one-time link
for each new device; you do not need the original token to reconnect. Links
created in Settings can only be copied from the client that created them while
its Connections page stays open. If you leave or reload that page, create
another link to share.

### Reach one machine several ways

A saved machine can keep several routes, including LAN, Tailscale, a public URL,
and SSH. Pair it again using another address, or choose **Add route** from its
route list. Both addresses belong to the same machine in your client.

Supacode also learns the LAN and Tailscale addresses reported by a paired
machine. Enable **Network access** on the host to make its LAN address available.
Learned addresses follow network changes and use the existing pairing. They go
away when the host stops reporting them or you remove the pairing they came from.

Routes are tried in preference order. An unavailable LAN address falls back to
another saved route. Supacode checks for a preferred route when your network
changes, when you return to the app, and periodically while using a fallback.
A browser opened over HTTPS needs HTTPS routes; it cannot connect to plain HTTP
LAN addresses.

On web and desktop, open the machine's routes in **Settings → Connections** to
reorder or remove them. On mobile, open the machine under
**Settings → Environments** and choose **Edit**. Learned routes can be reordered,
but removing their saved pairing also removes the addresses learned through it.

Open **Permissions** next to **Routes** in web or desktop, or **Your permissions**
in the mobile route details, to see what your current connection can do on that
environment. For a remote environment, this is in its route details. Permissions
shown there apply only to the route marked **In use**; other routes are not
checked. Direct pairing and Supacode Connect have separate sessions and may grant
different permissions.

### Balance new threads across machines

Auto balance is off by default. On web and desktop, enable it in
**Settings → Connections → Load balancing** to automatically choose a machine for
new threads in projects grouped across connected environments. The section
appears once two or more machines are switched on.
Each machine starts at **Normal**. Choose **Prefer** to favor it when it has CPU and
memory available, **Less often** to reduce its share, or **Manual only** to exclude
it from automatic selection. These are preferences, not fixed traffic percentages.
Preferences are saved separately in each client.

The composer checks eligible machines when choosing a draft's environment, then keeps
that choice stable. Choose **Auto balance** again to check current resources, or choose
a specific machine to override it. Choosing a branch or worktree also keeps the draft
on that machine. Existing threads stay where they started. If resource checks are
unavailable or all eligible machines are full, choose a machine manually to continue.
Mobile keeps its manual environment selection.

### Tailscale HTTPS

Join both devices to the same tailnet. In the desktop app, enable **Tailscale
HTTPS** in **Settings → Connections**. Turn it off there to remove that route.

To start a command-line server with Tailscale HTTPS:

```bash
supacode serve --tailscale-serve
```

For an already-running server:

```bash
supacode pair --tailscale
```

The pairing link uses an address such as `https://machine.tailnet.ts.net/`.
The mapping created by `pair --tailscale` persists across restarts. Remove its
default-port mapping with:

```bash
tailscale serve --https=443 off
```

If that port is already in use, choose another with
`--tailscale-serve-port`. See `supacode pair --help` for other pairing options.

### Hosted web app

A web app served over HTTPS needs an HTTPS endpoint. It connects directly
to your server; a hosted pairing link does not make an unreachable backend
reachable or convert HTTP to HTTPS.

For a plain HTTP LAN endpoint, use the direct pairing URL in a browser that can
open it, or pair from the desktop app. On mobile, an IP address entered without a
scheme uses HTTP, so include `https://` when your server uses HTTPS.

## Desktop-managed SSH

In the desktop app, open **Settings → Connections → Add environment**, choose
**SSH**, and enter a host or SSH alias such as `user@example.com`. Supacode starts
or reuses a server there and opens the port forward for you. Projects, provider
credentials, and agent work stay on the remote machine.

The remote host must be Linux or an Apple Silicon Mac with `curl` or `wget`,
`tar`, `sha256sum` or `shasum`, and [provider setup](./install.md#providers).
The first launch downloads Supacode's server to `~/.supacode/runtime` on the host, so
it takes longer than later ones.
Provider CLIs must be on the `PATH` of a non-interactive login shell there;
check with:

```bash
ssh user@example.com 'sh -lc "command -v claude codex"'
```

If SSH reconnecting fails after an app update, retry the launch once. Removing
the connection stops a server that Supacode launched; a server that was already
running is left alone.

[remote sign-in](./providers-antigravity.md#sign-in-from-a-remote-device).

## Browser on a remote environment

Browser tabs belong to the environment, so you and your agents see the same
tabs from any device. The desktop app shows its own environment's tabs
directly. Every other device, and the desktop app for other environments,
streams them from the host. Agents keep using them while no device is
connected, and `localhost` addresses reach servers on the host.

The first tab downloads a headless Chrome, about 120 MB, into the Supacode home. It
is the same browser [HTML renders](html-renders.md) use, so a host downloads it
only once. Some Linux hosts need [setup](#browser-host-setup) before it can
start.

Agent tabs have separate storage and share a Chromium process. Take control before
typing into an agent's tab, then release control when you want the agent to
continue. Read-only connections can watch without changing the page.

While you have control, the tab works with your device: text the page copies or
cuts goes to your clipboard, a file picker on the page opens your device's
picker, and a finished download is offered for you to save. Popups such as
sign-in windows open as their own tabs. Downloads stay on the host until the
tab closes. Audio does not play on your device.

On a phone, tap the floating preview's corner dot to show its controls, then
**Pop into separate window** to keep watching in picture-in-picture over other
apps.

### Browser host setup

macOS, Windows, and Linux desktops run the browser as is. Some Linux hosts need
one-time setup: Ubuntu 23.10 and later block the sandbox the browser runs in,
and minimal images and containers lack libraries it loads. When that happens,
the server says so at startup, and browser tabs and HTML previews show the
command to run on the host:

```sh
sudo supacode browser setup
```

The server shows the exact line for how you started it, such as
`sudo npx supacode browser setup`, and keeps your `PATH` when Node is installed only
for your user. Where `supacode` is not on your `PATH`, such as with only the
desktop app installed, it names the full path of the app's own `supacode` instead. It allows Chrome's sandbox with an AppArmor profile and installs
any missing libraries with apt. It is safe to run again. Without `sudo`, it
only reports what it would change.

The browser always runs in Chrome's sandbox. Where you cannot change the host,
set `SUPACODE_SERVER_BROWSER_SANDBOX=0` for the environment to run without it.

## Connect an outside agent

Claude Code, Codex, ChatGPT and other agents Supacode did not start can drive
threads on an environment through its MCP server. See
[outside agents](./outside-agents.md) for setup.

## Manage or revoke access

On the host, **Settings → Connections** lets authorized administrators create
pairing links and revoke client sessions. Revoking an unused link prevents new
pairings; revoke a device's session to remove its existing access. Command-line
management is available through `supacode auth --help`.

To restore a device whose session was revoked, pair it again with a fresh link.
If the link's address is one the device already uses for that machine but cannot
reach right now, such as a LAN address while on cellular, it pairs through the
machine's other saved routes instead.

A session with an open connection stays listed after its access credential
expires.

To choose a token's permissions, pass `--scope` once for each scope you want:

```sh
npx supacode pair --scope orchestration:read --scope terminal:read
```

The selected scopes replace the default permissions. The same option works with
`npx supacode auth pairing create` and `npx supacode auth session issue`; each command's
`--help` lists the available scopes. Without `--scope`, pairing tokens retain
standard client permissions and issued bearer sessions retain administrative
permissions.

To change an existing client's permissions, create a fresh pairing link with the
scopes it needs. In a browser opened directly on the environment, open that link
to replace the browser's current grant. For mobile or a saved remote environment
in web or desktop, use **Add Environment** with the fresh link or code; pairing
the same environment replaces its saved grant. Reconnecting alone does not change
permissions.

Grouping checkouts does not combine their permissions. Shared project settings
require `orchestration:operate` on every member environment; actions on one
checkout use that checkout's permissions.

`source-control:write` covers direct Git and pull request changes made from the
client: pushing, switching or creating branches, cloning, and removing
worktrees. It does not restrict what a task does. Starting a task in a new
worktree still creates that branch and worktree with `orchestration:operate`,
and the agent it runs can use Git however the environment allows.

Settings changes, provider management, and environment maintenance can be granted
separately from access administration. New standard pairings include these
permissions. Existing clients can stay connected after an update, but newly separated
features may require pairing again with the permissions they need. Older clients
may show controls that the server denies. Create a fresh pairing link to change
a client's permissions.

`filesystem:read` allows browsing host files, opening workspace files, and viewing
local changes. Add `filesystem:write` to allow editing files or saving plans to
the workspace. These scopes control direct file access from the client.

Treat pairing URLs and pairing codes as passwords. Do not include them in
screenshots, logs, or bug reports.

## Using the Desktop App as a Remote Only

If a computer should only drive work running elsewhere, turn off its local environment. In the
desktop app, open **Settings → Connections** and switch off **Local
environment**. Supacode restarts without a local server: no local agents or terminals run, WSL
backends stay off, and other devices can no longer connect to this computer. Your projects,
history, and saved connections are kept, and you keep working through paired environments or SSH.

Switch **Local environment** back on in the same place to restart with your previous local
settings.
