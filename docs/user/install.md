# Install Supacode

Supacode runs coding agents on your computer and lets you control them from its
desktop, web, or mobile app. Set up the machine where the agents will work first.

## Requirements

You need an installed, authenticated provider before starting a thread. You can
launch Supacode and configure providers afterwards.

## From source

Use Node.js 24 and the Mise-managed project tools. Get the source from
[supabitapp/supacode-next](https://github.com/supabitapp/supacode-next), install Mise using the
[development toolchain instructions](../../README.md#install-the-development-toolchain),
and run these commands from the repository root:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
mise install --locked
mise exec -- vp i
mise exec -- vp run dev
```

Open the pairing URL printed by the dev runner to connect the web app.
See [development](../operations/development.md) for desktop and mobile builds.

On Windows, in PowerShell, install the packaged command line with:

```powershell
irm https://next.supacode.sh/install.ps1 | iex
```

This puts `supacode` in `~/.local/bin`. If your shell reports `command not found`
afterwards, add that directory to `PATH`. Set `SUPACODE_CHANNEL=nightly` to install
the nightly train, or `SUPACODE_VERSION` to pin an exact version.

### Intel Macs

The pre-commit hook tool is not available for Intel macOS. Install the project tools and run the
server without installing hooks:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
mise install --locked
mise exec -- vp i
mise exec -- vp run dev
```

## Command line

If you have a packaged `supacode` executable installed, these commands are available:

| Task                                             | Command                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Start the server and open the web app            | `supacode`                                                      |
| Start the server without a browser               | `supacode serve`                                                |
| Keep it running in the background (macOS, Linux) | `supacode service install` ([details](./background-service.md)) |
| Move to the newest release                       | `supacode update`                                               |
| Remove it again                                  | `supacode uninstall`                                            |

Run `supacode --help` for the full reference.

## Desktop app

Build the desktop client from this repository. Distribution artifacts belong to
Supacode's [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/supabitapp/supacode-next/releases).

### The `supacode` command

The desktop app includes the `supacode` command-line tool. To run it from any
terminal, open **Settings → General → About** and choose **Install** next to
**supacode command**. On macOS and Linux it adds a `supacode` link to a folder on your
`PATH`; on Windows it adds the app's command folder to your `PATH`. Open a new
terminal afterwards. **Remove** takes it off again. If you already have `supacode`
from npm, it stays as it is.

### Windows Subsystem for Linux

Choose a WSL distro in **Settings → Connections** to run agents and projects
there. Install the provider CLIs inside that distro. Supacode installs its own
server runtime there automatically; the first launch after an app update can
take longer.

### Open a project from a terminal

With the desktop app already running on the same machine:

```bash
supacode app
```

This opens a new thread for the current directory, adding the project if needed.
Pass a path, such as `supacode app ../my-project`, to open another directory. It requires
the desktop app, so a standalone server or an SSH session is not enough. If the
command cannot reach the app, start or update the desktop app and try again.

## Mobile app

Build the mobile client using the [mobile development guide](../../apps/mobile/README.md).
The phone connects to a server on another machine. Follow
[remote access](./remote-access.md) to pair it with a pairing URL or QR code.

If the app crashes during launch, open Settings → Diagnostics on the next launch
that succeeds. It lists startup crashes from the last 7 days with the error and
component stack that store crash reports leave out. Copy the report and paste it
into a GitHub issue. Error messages can quote values from the app, so read it over
before sharing.

## Providers

Open **Settings → Providers** in the web or desktop app, select the environment,
and enable the provider you want. Installation, login, and configuration belong
to that environment's machine, even when you connect from a phone or another
computer.

| Provider    | Install and authenticate                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Codex       | [Connect with ChatGPT](./providers-codex.md#connect-with-chatgpt), or install [Codex CLI](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli) and run `codex login`. |
| Claude      | Install [Claude Code](https://claude.com/product/claude-code), then run `claude auth login`.                                                              |
| Cursor      | Install [Cursor CLI](https://cursor.com/cli), then run `agent login`.                                                                                     |
| Grok Build  | Install [Grok Build CLI](https://x.ai/cli), then run `grok login`.                                                                                        |
| OpenCode    | Install [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai), then run `opencode auth login`.                                                                                  |
| Antigravity | Install and sign in with Google from Supacode's provider settings.                                                                                        |
| Pi          | Install [Pi](https://pi.dev), then run `pi` once to finish its login or API-key setup.                                                                    |

Provider CLIs must be on the server's `PATH`. If Supacode cannot find one, set its
**Binary path** in provider settings, especially when using a version manager.
Cursor's executable is `cursor-agent`, although its login command is
`agent login`. Codex connected through ChatGPT and Antigravity can use their
managed runtimes without a `PATH` entry.

Supacode warns when a provider version has known compatibility problems with your
release. Check **Settings → Providers** on that environment for the recommended
version or range. When its package manager supports installing a specific version,
you can install the recommendation there. Otherwise use the provider's installer
on the environment's machine. An unlisted version is unverified.

When a provider CLI is behind its latest release, its provider card shows the
available version. **Update now** runs the installer that owns the CLI
(Homebrew, or a global npm, pnpm, Yarn, Bun, Volta, or Vite+ install), or the
CLI's own update command when Supacode cannot tell. Update a CLI installed with
mise through mise. Cursor and Antigravity update with Supacode. Homebrew installs
compare against the version Homebrew offers, which can trail the npm release by
a few hours.

Add another provider instance for a separate account or configuration. Each
instance can have its own environment variables, such as API keys or a custom
base URL. Mark secret values as sensitive; after saving, Supacode does not display
their original values.

For provider-specific setup and accounts, see [Codex](./providers-codex.md),
[Claude](./providers-claude.md), [OpenCode](./providers-opencode.md),
[Antigravity](./providers-antigravity.md), and [Pi](./providers-pi.md).
