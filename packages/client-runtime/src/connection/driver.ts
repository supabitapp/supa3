 * timeout. A route that fails to connect moves on to the next so an
 * unavailable address cannot hide a working LAN or Tailscale route.
 *
 * Slow routes are tried in the order their checks answer, so a tailnet still
 * waking up after a network change goes ahead of a LAN that will never answer.
 * Silent routes are tried last, in preference order, once every slow check has
 * answered or timed out, since a check is not proof.
 *
 * The reported error is a transient one when any route failed transiently,
 * so the supervisor keeps retrying a route that may come back; a blocked
 * error is reported only when every attempted route was blocked.
